          My name is Hayk, I am 15 years old and I am Armenian. I studied Web<br />
          Front-End Development at Smart Code to become a good programmer. At<br />
          first, when I was learning HTML 5 and CSS, everything seemed very<br />
          easy, but then, when I switched to JavaScript and React.js,
          everything<br />
          became increasingly complicated, but I did not despair and did not<br />
          leave my favorite job. I continued to overcome all the difficulties<br />
          and was able to become the programmer of my dreams.<br />
